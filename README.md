## What is this thing?
This is a recipe app for home and professional baristas to use to organize their espresso recipes and other general coffee related recipes. The user can create recipes using a loosely structured form, so as not to limit the user's imagination for their recipes. React is the framework used for the frontend, Redux for front end state management and Node.js and Express for the backend.
